# Extra Image List

>Original addon & documentation can be found at: <b>[MeshLogic / Extra Image List](https://meshlogic.github.io/posts/blender/addons/extra-image-list/)</b>

I added a cleaner look to the panel and added the panel settings to option bool. I also added source image so users can pick image sequence or sinle image. I Also added is showing the image texture name above its size, this is very convienent because the source path only shows a very small section. This makes it much easier to identify the used texture.
